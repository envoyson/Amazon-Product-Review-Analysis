# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores customer reviews from Amazon products using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover patterns in review scores, product popularity, and customer sentiment.

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** Provided via LMS
- **Features:** `product_id`, `review_text`, `rating`, `review_date`, `customer_id`

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (for data cleaning)
- Power BI (for visualization)

## Key EDA Steps
- Cleaned missing and duplicate data
- Analyzed rating distribution
- Identified most-reviewed and highest-rated products
- Detected trends in customer sentiment using average ratings
- Used Power BI to build interactive dashboards

## Key Insights
- Most reviews fall between 4 and 5 stars
- Product **ABC123** received the highest number of reviews
- A small number of products account for the majority of reviews
- Reviews with 1-star ratings often mention delivery or packaging issues

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights which products perform best, common areas of customer dissatisfaction, and how review trends can inform product and marketing strategies.
